# Dicta App for creating your online dictionary

The Dicta App is a tool for creating your own online dictionary. The app is built using React and makes use of the Firebase database and authentication services to store and manage data.

The app is built using the following technologies:

- React: a frontend library for building user interfaces
- Firebase: a cloud platform that provides a variety of services, including a database and authentication services

With the Dicta App, you can create your own dictionary by adding entries for titles and their definitions. In addition to the dictionary functionality, the Dicta App also includes authentication features powered by Firebase. This allows you to create an account and securely log in to the app to access your dictionary. Your data is securely stored in the Firebase database and is accessible only to you.
